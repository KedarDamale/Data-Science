    "# Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) - Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Definition:\n",
    "# Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) consisting of multiple layers of neurons (also called perceptrons).\n",
    "# It is designed to model complex, non-linear relationships in data by learning hierarchical feature representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Extension of Single-Layer Perceptron:\n",
    "# Unlike a single-layer perceptron which can only solve linearly separable problems,\n",
    "# MLP overcomes this limitation by adding one or more hidden layers and using non-linear activation functions.\n",
    "# This allows it to learn and approximate non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Linear vs Non-linear Separability:\n",
    "# - Linear separability means classes can be separated by a single straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) without error.\n",
    "# - If such a hyperplane exists, data is linearly separable.\n",
    "# - Otherwise, data is non-linearly separable, requiring more complex models like MLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Architecture of MLP:\n",
    "# - Input Layer:\n",
    "#   Accepts raw input features (x1, x2, x3, ..., xn). \n",
    "#   This layer only passes inputs forward and does not perform computations.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# - Hidden Layer(s):\n",
    "#   One or more layers between input and output layers.\n",
    "#   Each neuron in these layers:\n",
    "#     * Receives inputs weighted by learned weights.\n",
    "#     * Adds a bias term.\n",
    "#     * Applies a non-linear activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh).\n",
    "#   Hidden layers transform input features into intermediate representations, Intermediate representations are the new features or \n",
    "#                                                                             abstractions that the network creates inside the hidden\n",
    "#                                                                             layers by transforming raw input features through learned\n",
    "#                                                                             weights, biases, and nonlinear activations.\n",
    "#   enabling the network to learn non-linear and hierarchical patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Output Layer:\n",
    "#   Receives activations from the last hidden layer.\n",
    "#   Combines them linearly (weighted sum + bias).\n",
    "#   Applies an activation function suitable for the task (e.g., sigmoid for binary classification, softmax for multi-class).\n",
    "#   Produces the final output/prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Computation Flow (Forward Propagation):\n",
    "# For each layer l:\n",
    "#   z^(l) = W^(l) * a^(l-1) + b^(l)    # Linear transformation\n",
    "#   a^(l) = f(z^(l))                   # Non-linear activation function\n",
    "# where:\n",
    "#   - W^(l) is the weight matrix of layer l\n",
    "#   - b^(l) is the bias vector of layer l\n",
    "#   - a^(l-1) is the activation from previous layer (input features for l=1)\n",
    "#   - f(.) is the activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Training:\n",
    "# MLPs are trained using supervised learning.\n",
    "# - A loss function (e.g., cross-entropy, mean squared error) measures prediction error.\n",
    "# - Backpropagation computes gradients of loss w.r.t weights and biases using chain rule.\n",
    "# - Optimizers (e.g., gradient descent, Adam) update parameters to minimize loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Importance of Hidden Layers:\n",
    "# - Introduce non-linearity to the model.\n",
    "# - Extract and learn useful intermediate features.\n",
    "# - Enable learning of complex patterns beyond linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "# - Facilitate hierarchical feature abstraction (simple features combined into complex ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Summary:\n",
    "# MLPs are powerful universal function approximators capable of modeling any continuous function given sufficient hidden units and data.\n",
    "# They form the basis of deep learning when stacked into many layers.\n",

    "## 🔍 Why Use CNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional ANNs **struggle with high-dimensional inputs** like images. For example, a 256×256 RGB image has 256×256×3 = **196,608 input features**. Fully connecting all neurons would result in **huge computation and overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs **reduce the number of parameters**, capture **spatial features**, and provide **translation invariance** using three core concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local connectivity**\n",
    "2. **Parameter sharing**\n",
    "3. **Downsampling (pooling)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 CNN Architecture Components (Layer by Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Input Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accepts the raw image (e.g., 28×28 grayscale image → shape = 28×28×1)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Convolutional Layer (`Conv2D`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Detect **features** like edges, corners, textures, shapes, etc.\n",
    "* **How it works**: Uses small filters (kernels), e.g., 3×3, that **slide over** the input image and perform **element-wise multiplication and summation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Mathematically:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Feature map} = \\text{Input} * \\text{Kernel}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each kernel produces **one feature map**\n",
    "* **Parameters** in kernels are learned during training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔑 Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Number of filters** (feature detectors)\n",
    "* **Kernel size** (e.g., 3×3, 5×5)\n",
    "* **Stride** (how many pixels to move the filter each step)\n",
    "* **Padding** (zero-padding to retain dimensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Activation Layer (ReLU)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applies **non-linearity** to feature maps\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Why?** CNN without non-linearity becomes just a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most common: **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**\n",

    "  \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. **Pooling Layer (`MaxPooling2D`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Downsample the spatial dimension → reduce computation and overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Max pooling**: selects maximum value in a patch\n",
    "* **Average pooling**: takes average\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., a 2×2 max pool reduces 4 values to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Flatten Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Converts the final pooled 2D feature maps into a **1D vector** for the dense layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Fully Connected Layer (Dense Layer)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Traditional neural network layer\n",
    "* Learns to map the extracted features to class scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., last Dense layer might have `n` neurons for `n` classes with a **Softmax** activation for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Output Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Depends on the task:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Binary classification**: 1 neuron with `sigmoid`\n",
    "  * **Multi-class classification**: `n` neurons with `softmax`\n",
    "  * **Regression**: linear activation\n",
