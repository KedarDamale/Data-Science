    "\n",
    "The **Standard Normal Distribution** is a special case of the normal distribution where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean $\\mu = 0$\n",
    "* Standard deviation $\\sigma = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the formula becomes:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, the variable is not $x$, but **z**, called the **z-score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why Standardize?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Makes it possible to **compare** different normal distributions.\n",

    "Any value $x$ from a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ can be **standardized** into a z-score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",

       "'\\nHypothesis testing is a **formal statistical method** used to make decisions or inferences about a population parameter based on sample data. It helps you determine whether there is enough evidence in your sample to support a specific claim (hypothesis) about the population.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Explanation of Hypothesis Testing\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. **Purpose**\\n\\nTo test a claim or assumption (called a hypothesis) about a population parameter (like mean, proportion, variance) using sample data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Basic Terminology**\\n\\n* **Population parameter:** The actual value in the population (e.g., population mean $\\\\mu$) which is usually unknown.\\n* **Sample statistic:** Computed from the sample (e.g., sample mean $\\x08ar{x}$) used to estimate the population parameter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Hypotheses**\\n\\n* **Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The default assumption or claim that there is *no effect* or *no difference*. It usually states equality or no change.\\n  Example: $H_0: \\\\mu = \\\\mu_0$\\n\\n* **Alternative hypothesis ($H_a$ or $H_1$)**: The claim that contradicts the null hypothesis; it represents the effect or difference you want to test for.\\n  Example: $H_a: \\\\mu \\neq \\\\mu_0$ (two-tailed), or $H_a: \\\\mu > \\\\mu_0$ (right-tailed), or $H_a: \\\\mu < \\\\mu_0$ (left-tailed)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. **Test Statistic**\\n\\nA numerical summary calculated from the sample that helps decide whether to reject $H_0$.
